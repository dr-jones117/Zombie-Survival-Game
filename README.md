# PyZombi
A wave based zombie survival game made using python and pygame

Made this in the summer of 2021 before I went back to college. I wanted to learn to code before going to school so this was the result.

## Features
- Shooting zombies
- Picking up ammo
- Score, Health, and Ammo system
- Zombies that swell into crowds when close together
- Background music
